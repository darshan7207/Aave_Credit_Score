Assignment 2: Wallet Risk Scoring From Scratch

Data Collection:
Wallet transaction history was fetched using The Graphâ€™s Compound V2 subgraph (harsh-eth/compound-v2-ethereum).
Actions fetched included borrow, repay, deposit, redeem, and liquidationcall. These were retrieved for 100 wallets provided in the assignment.

Feature Engineering:
For each wallet, the following features were calculated:
- tx_count: Total transactions
- borrow_count, repay_count, deposit_count, liquidation_count, redeem_count
- repay_ratio: repay_count / (borrow_count + 1)
- deposit_ratio: deposit_count / (tx_count + 1)
- liquidation_ratio: liquidation_count / (tx_count + 1)

Scoring Logic:
Final score = repay_ratio * 400 + deposit_ratio * 300 + (1 - liquidation_ratio) * 200 + min(tx_count, 50) * 2
All scores were clipped to the range [0, 1000].
